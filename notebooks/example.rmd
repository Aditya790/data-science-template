This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Executing a chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Environment setup

First, we initialise and setup the environment. It is important to not make assumptions about state that is already loaded.

```{r clear environment, include=FALSE}

# clear workspace - Good code practice to do first. We remove all currently loaded packages, console, vars and figures

#install.packages("mise")
mise::mise(vars = TRUE, pkgs = FALSE, figs = TRUE, console = TRUE)
```

## Setup and configuration

The following are various setup and configuration options used when running this analysis to ensure that results a reproducable.

```{r include packages}

#install.packages("readr")
library(readr)

```

### Session information

```{r session info, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```

### Localisation

```{r localisation info, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
readr::locale() # set the locale to ensure reproducable results
```
